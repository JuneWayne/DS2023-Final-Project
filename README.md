### Meet the team: Ethan Vinith, Alieen

-----------------------------------------

This project focused on patient recovery post ACLR surgery, by utilizing averages of recovery times and tragetories to track the progress of a specific patient. Through working on this project we learned different visualization methods of comparison with a group to provide insights for an individual. These skills will be pertinent to our careers as data scientists as methods of comparison of means and averages can be applied across all types of data.
