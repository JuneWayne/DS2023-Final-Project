### Project Overview  
This project focuses on **patient recovery following ACLR (Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction) surgery**, utilizing peer group averages to track and interpret the recovery trajectory of a specific patient.  

We developed visualizations that compare an individual patient's progress against benchmarks from similar patients, helping to contextualize whether the patient is "on track."

### Key Takeaways  
- Through working on this project, we learned different visualization methods of comparison with a group to provide insights for an individual.

- While developing these visualizations, we also learned the importance of full exploration of all the variables in a dataset â€” especially in cases like ours, where numerous variables address similar things, such as time.

- These skills will be pertinent to our careers as data scientists, as methods of comparing means and averages can be applied across all types of data.

- Additionally, the foundational skills of developing and fine-tuning visualizations can be applied to many future project reports, presentations, and even research posters.
