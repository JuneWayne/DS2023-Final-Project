### Meet the Team  
**Ethan**, **Vinith**, **Aileen**

### Project Overview  
This project focuses on **patient recovery following ACLR (Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction) surgery**, utilizing peer group averages to track and interpret the recovery trajectory of a specific patient.  

We developed visualizations that compare an individual patient's progress against benchmarks from similar patients, helping to contextualize whether the patient is "on track."

### Key Takeaways  
Throughout this project, we learned:

- How to design **visualizations that emphasize group-to-individual comparison**.
- The importance of **exploratory data analysis**, especially when working with large datasets containing overlapping or related variables (e.g., time since surgery in various formats).
- Skills in **constructing clean, insightful visuals**, which will be valuable for future data-driven reports, dashboards, or research posters.
- Broad applicability of **mean/average-based comparison frameworks** in real-world data science tasks.
