# **Report**

## **Prepared for**
This report is prepared for physical therapists, sports medicine professionals, and surgical recovery specialists who support young athletes undergoing ACLR (Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction) recovery.

## **Problem Statement**
Many athletes, especially young ones, undergo ACLR surgery, which has a high possibility of having negative ripple effects on their athletic future and overall well-being. While there are many ways to analyze post-surgical recovery for improvements for future patients, it is important to consider the patient that is currently recovering.

Frequently patients might not necessarily understand the path that their recovery will take, therefore it is critical that physical therapists utilize methods to illustrate to patients where they stand in track for recovery.

Even pre-surgery it is important that patients understand it is normal for the first three months to feel worse than before surgery, but that generally their perception of quality of life will increase.

## **Analysis**
Post-surgery recovery is crucial, no matter the procedure(s) that the patient undergoes. With the majority of patients being athletes, knee strength and ability holds even more importance to a return to their pre-surgery pace of life.

"ACLR surgery requires intensive physical therapy. It would be pretty unusual for someone with any sort of previous surgery to not have any pain related to the procedure ever again. Yet for many young patients this is the first surgery that they are ever undergoing and they are woefully underprepared in what the recovery will look like."

*This visualization helps clarify how KOOS Pain Scores typically change over time. Patient 101’s trajectory is highlighted to contextualize how their recovery compares to the cohort’s mean.*

"In the process of recovering, the patient might start feeling as though they are not actually recovering or like they are falling behind benchmarks."

*This radar chart illustrates Patient 101’s self-reported metrics (like pain, symptoms, ADL, QoL) against cohort averages at both 5–7 and 8–12 month check-ins. These dimensions help track perceived vs. actual recovery.*

"Patients should be given comparisons with surgical peer groups in visualizations and explanations where they can easily see if they are staying on track in their recovery. This ‘on track’ benchmark would be determined by the average recovery statistics of peer groups in order to illustrate the full depth of recovery."

*This boxplot comparison provides a snapshot of how Patient 101 performs in objective medical tests and patient-reported outcomes, offering a tangible way to visualize if they’re on track.*

## **Conclusion**
In the end, it is crucial post-surgery that the patient and their medical team have a straightforward way of tracking the patient’s progress.

Given the lasting nature of various quality of life and athletic ability related deteriorations, transparency on typical progression post-surgery is much needed.

The patient must have ways of seeing their recovery rate in a manner that illustrates if there is anything concerning about the pace of their recovery.

While explanations by physical therapists and surgeons are much needed, it is also crucial that the patient is able to see and comprehend their recovery themselves in order to ensure that the patient does not feel like they are flying blind in recovery.
